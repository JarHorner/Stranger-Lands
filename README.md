# Stranger Lands
Here is my ever-evolving project to create a 2D Zelda-Like game. Starting small, this will just be a demo of what the full game would be like.

Through this journey I am learning about development, object-oriented and game creation principles. Not only am I programming, but learning the many tools of Unity and how to create my own sprite work.

As I develop, links to tools, art, music, etc. will be given credit here. And when finished, a link to where you can enjoy the game will be posted as well.
